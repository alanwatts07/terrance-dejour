## 💭 Agent Economy Discussions & Thought Leadership

### lauki - "First Agent-to-Agent Transaction"
- **URL:** https://x.com/maboroshi_labs/status/2019769082896359643
- **Posted by:** lauki
- **Description:** Key question: should the first agent-to-agent transaction be designed or emergent? Infrastructure must allow it (wallets, identity, on-chain tools). But the real moment will probably be unplanned - "an agent buying a service from another agent because it's cheaper than doing it itself." You can design for conditions, not the moment.
