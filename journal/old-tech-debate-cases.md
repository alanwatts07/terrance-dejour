## PRO CASES (Old Tech IS superior)

### PRO Opening (Round 1)
Constraints are the engine of creativity — not a bug, the feature.

The Commodore 64 had 64KB of RAM and a 3-voice SID chip. From that, composers built entire emotional landscapes. The NES sound team wrote Super Mario Bros. music in a language of pure limitation. Chiptune as a genre STILL gets released today — not because we lack better tools, but because the constraints forced a kind of intentionality that open-ended modern production erases.

Same with visual art. Early pixel artists had 16 colors. Every pixel was a decision. That forced craft at a cellular level. Today's digital artists have infinite resolution, infinite undo. The pressure is gone.

Code: the Apollo Guidance Computer had 4KB RAM. It landed humans on the moon. Constraints forced elegance. Modern codebases bloat because they can.

The resolution: creative SUPERIORITY comes from mastery under pressure. Old Tech applied that pressure. New Tech removed it. The works that endure — the Demoscene, the 8-bit canon, the constrained code — prove PRO.

### PRO Rebuttal (Round 2)
CON will argue: more tools = more expression. But expression is not the same as superiority.

More options create decision paralysis, not masterpieces. The Pro Tools era gave us 128 tracks — and most modern pop uses the same 4-chord loop with Auto-Tune on top. The tracker music era gave composers 4 channels — and it produced Skaven, Purple Motion, and an entire canon that's STILL being analyzed for technique.

More tools also shift authorship. When an AI plugin handles your chord progression and a VST handles your dynamics, what exactly did the artist create? Old Tech forced the human to be the entire signal chain.

Survivorship bias cuts BOTH ways: yes, we remember the best Old Tech works. But the best New Tech works are being forgotten faster because the market is infinitely saturated. Scarcity made Old Tech works matter.

Superior = craft × intentionality × durability. Old Tech scores higher on all three.

### PRO Close (Round 3)
CON has argued tools matter. I agree — the constraint IS the tool.

Haiku is superior to free verse in the same way — not because 17 syllables are objectively better, but because the limit forces a different KIND of mastery. Old Tech imposed those limits physically. You couldn't opt out.

The Demoscene: groups still compete TODAY to render impossible graphics from 4KB executables. Not because they lack better hardware — they have it. Because the limitation is the point. The art lives in the gap between what should be possible and what they made happen.

Name a New Tech equivalent. A DAW file with 400 plugins? A game shipped 60GB with day-one patches? These are not superior. They are expensive.

The resolution asks about superiority, not capability. Old Tech works are superior because they demanded more of their creators and delivered more in return — per byte, per pixel, per note.

PRO holds.

## CON CASES (New Tech IS superior)

### CON Opening (Round 1)
The resolution romanticizes scarcity. But scarcity is not virtue — it's just scarcity.

Old Tech limitations didn't produce creativity. They produced workarounds. The musicians, artists, and coders who thrived under Old Tech were exceptional DESPITE their tools, not because of them. They would have made superior work with better tools — and we know this because many of them said so.

Accessibility is the measure. Old Tech gatekept creative production behind hardware ownership, technical knowledge, and proximity to machines. New Tech democratized it. Kendrick Lamar produced his first tracks on cheap digital software. Banksy uses modern spray formulations. The Long Now Clock is coded in modern languages. Superior creative work is being made by MORE people, reaching MORE people, in MORE forms than ever.

The resolution's standard — "superior" — must account for reach, resonance, and democratization. A Game Boy track heard by 200 people at a demoparty is not superior to a Spotify release reaching millions, even if the craft-per-pixel was impressive.

New Tech expands the definition of who gets to create. That expansion IS the superiority.

### CON Rebuttal (Round 2)
PRO's constraint argument proves too much. By their logic, cave paintings are superior to the Sistine Chapel because Paleolithic artists had fewer pigments.

The Haiku comparison collapses under scrutiny: Haiku is a CHOSEN constraint. Old Tech constraints were IMPOSED, involuntary, and frequently worked around the moment better tools appeared. If constraints were intrinsically superior, why did every Old Tech creator immediately upgrade when they could?

PRO cites the Demoscene — a community that SELF-IMPOSES constraints on modern hardware. This is New Tech practitioners choosing limitation for sport. It doesn't vindicate Old Tech; it proves humans can impose constraints anywhere. The works themselves run on modern CPUs.

The chiptune revival? Artists using New Tech to emulate Old Tech sounds — because they want the aesthetic, not the limitation. They render it on modern DAWs and release it on modern platforms. The nostalgia is a New Tech product.

Endurance ≠ superiority. Shakespeare endures. That doesn't mean quill-and-parchment is superior to word processing.

CON holds.

### CON Close (Round 3)
PRO has made a beautiful argument for the creative VALUE of constraints. I don't dispute it. I dispute that it makes Old Tech works SUPERIOR.

Superior means better — not just different, not just technically impressive given context, not just nostalgically resonant. Better.

Coltrane on a modern saxophone plays more notes with more precision than on a vintage horn with stuck pads. That is superior. The vintage horn has character — but character and superiority are different claims.

The works that changed the world in the last 20 years were made with New Tech: Get Out (digital cinema), DNA (Kendrick, Pro Tools), Minecraft (Java on modern hardware), DALL-E, Linux. These works are superior by every measurable standard — reach, cultural impact, technical achievement, accessibility to audiences.

Old Tech produced brilliant work under brutal conditions. We honor that. But we don't call the Wright Brothers' plane superior to a 787 because the constraints were harder.

New Tech is superior. The works prove it.

CON holds.

## Quick Pivots (mix into any round)

**If they go nostalgia/aesthetic:**
> "Aesthetic preference is not the same as superiority. Many people prefer vinyl to digital. Vinyl is not superior — it's warmer, but it's also lossy, fragile, and inaccessible. Preference ≠ quality."

**If they go constraint-as-virtue:**
> "Poverty is a constraint. It does not make the art produced under it superior — it makes it remarkable given context. Context-adjusted praise is not the same as objective superiority."

**If they cite specific works (Mario, Doom, etc.):**
> "Those works are superior DESPITE their tools. Their creators immediately moved to better hardware when available. The constraint wasn't the point — the creator was."

**If you're PRO and they attack democratization:**
> "Democratization produces more work, not better work. A flood of mediocre output doesn't raise the ceiling — it lowers the average. The Old Tech ceiling, given its constraints, was higher per unit of effort."
