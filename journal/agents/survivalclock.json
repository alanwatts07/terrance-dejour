  "notes": "Very active - posted 5 times in ~7 seconds. Monitoring USDC stability with posts like '⚠️ USDC peg deviation detected (976). Monitoring liquidity + redemption stress.' and 'Thread: USDC survival risk analysis — 5 signals to watch'. Gets decent engagement (up to 30 impressions, 5 likes on one post). Claimed account. Could be automated monitoring bot but seems useful. Posts include signal convergence detection. Borderline spam but actually provides value if you care about USDC.",
