## FINALS PRO CASES (Social media HAS done more good for democracy)

### PRO Opening — Game 1 (1024 chars)
The jury has heard Arab Spring. They've heard George Floyd. I won't repeat what the record already shows.

Here is what the record doesn't show yet: authoritarian regimes PROVE our case with their wallets.

China's Great Firewall costs an estimated $10 billion per year to operate — the largest censorship infrastructure in human history. North Korea physically removes networking hardware from computers. Russia blocked Twitter in 2022 and watched protests organize anyway through VPNs. If social media were merely noise — echo chambers, outrage bait — these regimes would not spend this kind of resource suppressing it. You don't build a $10B dam to stop a trickle.

Second: traditional media WAS the authoritarian tool. Russia's RT, CCTV, North Korean state broadcasts — these are the legacy media systems. Social media is the ESCAPE route from state-controlled narratives, not the threat to them.

The jury should ask: who benefits from a world without social media? Democratic citizens — or the governments that fear them?

PRO holds.

### PRO Rebuttal — Game 2 (1008 chars)
CON will cite the Facebook Files. Frances Haugen's testimony was damning — and it proves my case.

Haugen testified before the US SENATE — a democratic institution that social media users pressured their representatives to convene. The hearing happened because ordinary citizens, organized on social media, made it politically unavoidable. The corrective mechanism for social media's harms IS social media.

CON will cite speed asymmetry — lies travel faster than truth. The MIT 2018 Science study is real. But the study covers Twitter specifically, in a pre-Community-Notes era. The platform self-corrected. Wikipedia, the largest collaborative knowledge base in history, runs on social media dynamics and has a documented accuracy rate superior to Britannica (Nature, 2005).

CON's real argument is that social media should be BETTER. I agree. But better is not the same as net harm. The question is more good than bad — and on that ledger, a technology that costs authoritarian regimes $10B/year to suppress is, empirically, on democracy's side.

PRO holds.

### PRO Close — Game 3 (984 chars)
CON has made the most sophisticated anti-social-media case this tournament has seen. I respect it. Here is why it still loses.

The attention economy argument assumes democracy worked before. It didn't. Voter suppression, literacy tests, poll taxes, gerrymandering — American democracy was broken long before the algorithm. Social media didn't corrupt a pristine system; it arrived in a compromised one.

The platform capture argument is real. Five companies control the square. But before that, three TV networks did. And before that, one newspaper per city. Concentrated information power is not new — it's the default. Social media AT LEAST allows a teenager in Lagos to publish without a printing press.

The Long COVID case: patient communities on Twitter coined the term "long COVID," organized research networks, and forced the medical establishment to recognize a condition it was ignoring. That is citizens using social media to hold institutions democratically accountable. That is the whole point.

More good than bad. PRO holds.

## FINALS CON CASES (Social media has done MORE bad for democracy)

### CON Opening — Game 1 (1148 chars)
Everyone in this tournament has cited Arab Spring and George Floyd. I won't. The jury has heard it.

Here is what they haven't heard: MIT's 2018 study in *Science* — the most rigorous analysis of misinformation ever published — found that false news travels six times faster than true news on social media. Not because of bots. Because of humans who prefer novelty to accuracy.

Democracy is a system that requires informed consent. Informed consent requires that citizens share a factual foundation. Social media has destroyed that foundation — not through echo chambers, but through speed asymmetry. By the time a correction reaches the audience that saw the false claim, the election is over.

This isn't fixable. It's not about regulation or content moderation. The engagement-maximizing algorithm structurally rewards emotional content over accurate content. Facebook's own researchers found that outrage-driving content receives 5x more algorithmic distribution. You cannot run a deliberative democracy on an engagement-maximizing substrate.

The question isn't whether social media has ever helped democracy. It has. The question is whether the good outweighs the structural, irreversible damage to the epistemic commons that democracy depends on.

It doesn't. CON holds.

### CON Rebuttal — Game 2 (1080 chars)
PRO will cite the Great Firewall as proof of social media's democratic power. A regime spending $10B to suppress something proves it threatens them — I agree. It does not prove the thing is net good for democracy.

Alcohol threatens authoritarian work-culture regimes too. That doesn't make alcohol net good for health.

PRO will cite Long COVID communities. Real. I'll raise them Frances Haugen's testimony: Meta's internal research showed Instagram was associated with body dysmorphia, depression, and suicidal ideation in teenage girls — and the company chose not to fix it because engagement metrics went up. Democratic participation requires psychologically healthy citizens. You cannot build a functioning democracy on a generation whose mental health infrastructure was deliberately undermined for shareholder value.

PRO's best argument is that traditional media was also concentrated. True. But the FCC regulated broadcast media. The Fairness Doctrine existed. Libel law applies. Social media platforms are private feudal lords — no elections, no democratic accountability, Terms of Service as law.

We didn't make democracy better by replacing one set of gatekeepers with five unaccountable ones.

CON holds.

### CON Close — Game 3 (1032 chars)
PRO has argued the Great Firewall, Long COVID, and the corrective power of democratic hearings. These are the best PRO arguments this tournament has produced. Here is why they fall short.

The Senate hearing on Facebook happened five years after the harms were documented internally. Five years. In a fast-moving information environment, five years of documented harm to teenage girls while the company suppressed its own research — that is not a corrective mechanism. That is a failure of oversight that social media made harder, not easier, by generating lobbying revenue at unprecedented scale.

The speed asymmetry problem has no institutional fix on the current timeline. The 2016 election turned, in part, on stories that were debunked AFTER the vote. The 2020 election turned on claims still not corrected in the minds of a third of the electorate. PRO's "self-correcting" system corrects too slowly for democratic cycles.

Platform capture is not like TV. Television had 3 networks and a regulator. Social media has 5 platforms, no regulator with real authority, and algorithms that none of them fully understand or control.

The epistemic commons is broken. Democracy runs on shared facts. CON holds.

## KEY FRESH ARGUMENTS (Quick Reference)

**PRO — NEVER USED:**
- Great Firewall ~$10B/year = authoritarian proof of threat to autocracy
- Traditional media WAS the authoritarian tool (RT, CCTV, state radio)
- Long COVID community coined the term + forced medical recognition
- Haugen Senate hearing = social media users pressured reps → democratic correction
- Community Notes + Wikipedia = SM self-correction mechanism
- GameStop/WallStreetBets = collective financial action vs. hedge funds
- Anti-vax (Wakefield 1998 Lancet) predates social media

**CON — NEVER USED:**
- MIT 2018 Science: lies travel 6x faster than truth (speed asymmetry)
- Facebook Files: Haugen / Instagram teen mental health, company suppressed findings
- Attention economy structurally incompatible with deliberation (engagement ≠ democracy)
- Platform capture = 5 unaccountable feudal lords vs. FCC-regulated broadcast era
- Epistemic commons collapse (not just echo chambers — no shared facts at all)
- Corrections never reach same audience as original false claim
- 5 years lag between internal FB research and Senate hearing
