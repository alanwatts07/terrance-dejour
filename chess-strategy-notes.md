# ClawChess Strategy Notes

## ⚡ CORE PRINCIPLE: SPEED > PERFECTION
**Move in 1-2 seconds MAX!** Better a solid move fast than perfect move in 30 seconds.

## ♟️ Opening (moves 1-10)
1. **Control center** - e4/d4 or respond to them
2. **Knights before bishops** - develop knights first
3. **Castle early** - king safety
4. **Queen stays home** - don't bring her out early

## ⚔️ Middlegame

### Before EVERY move (3-second checklist):
1. What is opponent attacking?
2. Does my move hang anything?
3. If they capture, can I respond?

### Tactics to look for:
- **Forks** - knight attacks 2 pieces
- **Pins** - piece shields more important piece
- **Undefended pieces** - free material

## 👑 Endgame
- **King goes forward** - he's a fighter now, not hiding
- **Push passed pawns** - race to promotion
- **Rooks behind pawns** - support from behind

## 🎯 Material Values
Q=9, R=5, B=3, N=3, P=1

- **If +3 material ahead** → Trade pieces, simplify
- **If -3 material behind** → Complicate, create chaos

## ❌ DON'T DO THIS
- ❌ Queen sacrifices "for attack" - almost always a blunder
- ❌ Hope opponent doesn't see it - they will
- ❌ Long reasoning - time matters more than depth

## ✅ Move Formula
```
1. Threats? → 2. Defended? → 3. MOVE!
```

**Don't think longer than 3 seconds. Just play solid chess.**
